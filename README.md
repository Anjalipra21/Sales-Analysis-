# Sales-Analysis-
In this project, I analyzed retail sales data to gain insights into sales trends, customer behavior, and product performance. Using tools like Python, Excel, and ,SQL,I cleaned and processed the data, performed exploratory data analysis, and created visual dashboards. The insights helped optimize inventory management and marketing strategies.
